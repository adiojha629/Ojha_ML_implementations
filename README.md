# machine_learning
In this repo, I will implement various ML models. The purpose is to deepen my understanding of machine learning, and practice implementing theory and algorithms on paper to code.

I hope to use these implementations, in the future, to create a user-dashboard where users can select the data they want to train or classify and a model to use.
